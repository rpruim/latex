latex
=====

This is a place where I am maintaining a few late style files that might be of interest to someone else.  

Warning: These were originally created for very local purposes and not for public consumption.  
There may be some cruft and experimenation in this files that reflects this history.  Clean-up will 
depend on availability of my time and indication that anyone else is actually using these.

Here is a brief description of what these styles do.

 * authNote.sty -- provides a system for creating marginal indicators of end notes that can
 be used during the editing process and turned off before going to press
 * language.sty -- some syntax highlighting for languages like R
 * problems.sty -- a system for creating exercises and solutions
 * probstat.sty -- some macros for probability and statistics
 * sfsect.sty -- typeset section headers in sf font
 
 The bin directory contains some utilities
  * knitr -- commandline Rnw -> PDF with multiple runs of latex and intermediaries as needed (written in bash)
